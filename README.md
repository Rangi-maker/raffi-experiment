Hi there! Thank you very much for taking part in our study. 

The study is best conducted on a laptop or desktop PC. Please read everything through before you start!

The study consists of two parts:

1. First, you have to do a personality test. When you carry out the test, please consider the following:

- Answer honestly, even if you don't like the answer.
- Describe yourself as you generally are now, not as you wish to be in the future.
- Your spontaneous answer is usually the most accurate.

Once you have finished the test, you will see your results. IMPORTANT: In order to guarantee anonymity please copy your personal ID, which you can find at the top right of the webside. Then open the link mentioned in 2. and paste it in the survey. 

The personality test opens in a new window: https://bigfive-test.com/

2. The second part of the study consists of a survey. After you have pasted the ID of your personality test in the respective window, just follow the instructions described in the beginning of the survey.

The whole study will take you about 15-20 minutes. Thanks in advance for your thoughtful completion of these questions â€” we really appreciate your time and effort!
